# NotSoSpeed

## Description
Not So Speed is a single-player version of the Speed card game. It has the same functionality, but without needing two players. When the player runs out of cards, the player must choose if the left or right deck has the higher total value of cards.

## How to Play
The player begins by flipping the first two table cards to see their hand. The player chooses between the five cards in their hand to place on the selected table deck. The maximum number of cards a player can have in their hand is 5. As the player is placing more cards on the table decks, the player is able to draw a card from the draw pile and continue finding matches. To match, the card has to have the value one higher or one lower than the last card on the table deck. If the player cannot find anymore matches, it is a stalemate, so the player can draw one card to place on each of the table decks in order to continue playing. The player either runs out of cards in their hand and the draw deck is empty, which gives the player a chance to choose the table deck with the highest value, or cannot make anymore moves, which means the player loses.

## Special Feature
Shuffle Button: Player can shuffle what’s in their hand if they can’t find a card to place
